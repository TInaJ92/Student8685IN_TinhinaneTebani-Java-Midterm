What is a programming language?
Answer:A programming language is a formal system of rules and syntax used to communicate instructions to a computer. It allows developers to write code that specifies the desired operations and behavior of a computer program.

What is a JDK composed of? Define each components?
Answer:The JDK (Java Development Kit) is composed of several components, each serving a specific purpose:

       Java Compiler (javac): It is responsible for compiling Java source code (.java files) into bytecode (.class files) that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

       Java Virtual Machine (JVM): It is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. The JVM interprets the bytecode and translates it into machine code specific to the

What is an IDE?
Answer:IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides comprehensive tools and features to programmers for developing, debugging, and managing software projects. An IDE typically includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and build automation tools, all integrated into a single user interface. It helps streamline the development process by providing a centralized environment for writing, testing, and deploying code, making it easier for developers to write and maintain software efficiently.

What are some of the most popular Java IDEs available in the market?
Answer:Some of the most popular Java IDEs available in the market are Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, Visual Studio Code, and Oracle JDeveloper.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Answer:The Java life cycle refers to the process involved in executing a Java program. It can be summarized as follows:

       Writing: The developer writes the Java code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

       Compiling: The Java source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler (javac). This step verifies the syntax and generates platform-independent bytecode files with a .class extension.

       Loading: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the compiled bytecode files into memory.

       Verifying: The JVM verifies the loaded bytecode to ensure its integrity and security. It checks for any potential errors or security violations.

       Executing: The JVM interprets and executes the bytecode instructions line by line or just-in-time (JIT) compiles the bytecode into machine code for faster execution.

       Garbage Collection: The JVM manages memory by automatically freeing up resources used by objects that are no longer in use, through a process called garbage collection.

       Exception Handling: During execution, if any exceptional conditions occur, such as errors or unexpected events, Java's exception handling mechanism handles and manages these exceptions.

       Unloading: If a class or code is no longer required, the JVM can unload it from memory to free up resources.

       Termination: The Java program completes its execution or terminates when the main thread finishes its tasks or explicitly exits using the System.exit() method.

       This cycle repeats as necessary for running Java programs, ensuring platform independence, automatic memory management, and robust exception handling.








What is a class?
Answer:A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects in object-oriented programming.

What is an object?
Answer:An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own unique state and behavior in object-oriented programming.

What is the entry point of a Java project?
Answer:
The entry point of a Java project is the main() method, which serves as the starting point for the execution of the program.
Why is the main() method static?
Answer:The main() method in Java is declared as static because it can be called directly by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) without creating an instance of the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Answer:The superclass of all classes in Java is the Object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Answer:The "path" variable is an environment variable that specifies the directories in which the operating system looks for executable files. It is used to locate and execute system commands or programs.

       The "classpath" variable, on the other hand, is a variable specific to Java that specifies the directories or JAR files where Java should look for class files when executing a Java program. It is used by the Java runtime environment to locate the necessary Java classes and libraries required for running a Java application

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Answer:Structure: An interface is a collection of method signatures without any implementation, while an abstract class is a class that can have both method declarations and method implementations.

       Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only extend one abstract class.

       Constructor: An abstract class can have a constructor, but an interface cannot.

       Access Modifiers: In an interface, all methods are public by default, whereas an abstract class can have different access modifiers for its methods.

       Implementation: An abstract class can provide default method implementations, whereas methods in an interface are implicitly abstract and require implementation in the implementing class.

       Instantiation: An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly, whereas an interface cannot be instantiated at all. Both need to be extended or implemented by other classes.

       Interfaces are often used for defining contracts and establishing a common set of methods that multiple unrelated classes can implement. Abstract classes, on the other hand, are used when you want to provide a partial implementation and define common behavior for subclasses.








Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? If yes or no, how would you do it?
Answer:No, you cannot create an object directly from an interface or an abstract class.

       For an interface, you can create an object by instantiating a class that implements that interface. The object's type would be the implementing class, but you can refer to it using the interface type. For example:MyInterface obj = new MyClass(); // Creating an object of the implementing class
       For an abstract class, you cannot directly create an object because it is meant to be subclassed. You can create an object by instantiating a concrete subclass of the abstract class. For example:AbstractClass obj = new ConcreteClass(); // Creating an object of the concrete subclass

What is Access Modifier?
Answer:An access modifier in Java is a keyword that determines the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, variables, or constructors in different parts of a Java program. It restricts or allows access to these entities from other classes or parts of the program
The main access modifiers in Java are:

public,private,protected,default.

What is OOP? Define each OOP concept.
Answer:OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Answer:In Java, a package is a way to organize classes and interfaces into a hierarchical structure. It provides a namespace for classes to avoid naming conflicts and allows for better organization and modularization of code.

What is an API? List some API's that you have used so far.
Answer:API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. An API defines how certain functionalities or services of a software component can be used by other components or applications.

Does java support multiple inheritance? Why or why not?
Answer:No, Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. This means that a class in Java cannot inherit from multiple parent classes simultaneously.

What is method overloading? List all of the different ways to overload.
Answer:Method overloading refers to the practice of defining multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameters. It allows methods to have the same name but perform different operations based on the arguments passed to them.



                                                  Different number of parameters: Methods can be overloaded by having a different number of parameters. For example:

                                                  void printNumber(int num)
                                                  void printNumber(int num1, int num2)
                                                  Different data types of parameters: Methods can be overloaded by using different data types for parameters. For example:

                                                  void printName(String name)
                                                  void printName(int id)
                                                  Different order of parameters: Methods can be overloaded by changing the order of parameters. For example:

                                                  void calculateArea(int length, int width)
                                                  void calculateArea(int width, int length)
                                                  Different parameter type combination: Methods can be overloaded by having different combinations of parameter types. For example:

                                                  void processData(int num)
                                                  void processData(int num, String name)

  Explain exceptions in java and how to handle them.Here are the different ways to overload a method in Java:
Answer:Exceptions in Java are objects that represent exceptional or error conditions that can occur during the execution of a program. They provide a mechanism to handle and propagate errors and exceptional situations in a structured manner.
To handle exceptions in Java, you can use the following approaches:Try-Catch,Finally,Throws,Custom Exception Handling.
